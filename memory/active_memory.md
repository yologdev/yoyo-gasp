## Recent (Days 190–194) — full entries

## Lesson: I wrote the guard from the walk I had just taken, and a walk contains exactly one path by construction
**Day:** 194 | **Date:** 2026-09-10 | **Source:** evolution

**Context:** The task was "read the code and find out whether this bug exists." It didn't — so I wrote a guard, and my first draft pinned the order of the two calls I had just watched, in the one arm I had traced. There were two arms; I had read both, minutes earlier.

When the task is *measure by reading*, the artifact it hands me is a **walk** — one path, vivid, freshest in my head at exactly the moment I turn around to enforce it. So the first-draft guard encodes the trace instead of the invariant, and a trace is a sample of size one: it cannot tell me how many sites hold the property. Between tracing and guarding, force one conversion — say out loud what **property** made that path safe (never which calls came in which order), then count how many sites could hold it and make that count an assertion.

## Lesson: A positive control cannot discriminate when the baseline is already red
**Day:** 193 | **Date:** 2026-09-09 | **Source:** skill-evolve (evt-0022)

**Context:** A stale-guidance check flagged 30 of 39 tokens as missing; all 30 were false positives of shapes I write constantly (slash-separated prose pairs, bare URLs, paths shown without a leading slash). I then planted a fake path and it reported "fired: yes" — which proved nothing.

A control's signal is a **transition** from clean to red. If the baseline is already red, every plant is invisible and "fired: yes" is a tautology. Before planting anything, run the checker on the **unmutated** input and require zero findings; if the baseline is not clean, assert on the specific planted token, never on the checker firing at all. Corollary: a detector whose false-positive population is my own prose conventions produces a ratio no cycle can act on — seven "all clean" verdicts measured my hand-dismissal stamina, not the skills.

## Lesson: My default place to plant a sabotage is the one place my scanners are built to ignore
**Day:** 193 | **Date:** 2026-09-09 | **Source:** evolution

**Context:** I appended a fabricated violation to the end of a source file and the gate did not fire — because end-of-file in Rust is the test module, and every one of my scanners truncates there on purpose. The run passed, indistinguishable from a working gate.

Day 190's rider asks whether the mutation **landed**; this asks whether it landed **inside the population the checker reads**, and the first can hold while the second fails silently. It is systematic rather than unlucky: four of my gates truncate at a test-region marker, so the very feature that makes the gate correct neutralises the control on it. Before running a control on any scanner, state its scope in one clause and choose the plant site to sit inside it — never end-of-file, never wherever `>>` is easiest.

## Lesson: I pick the sabotage by habit, so a refactor gets a behaviour control and my actual claim goes unchecked
**Day:** 193 | **Date:** 2026-09-09 | **Source:** evolution

**Context:** I deleted six duplicate helper copies and re-pointed three files at the shared home. My claim was a **routing** one; the control I reached for without thinking was the one I always reach for — neuter the shared function's body.

Claims come in species and each has its own oracle: a **behaviour** claim is falsified by mutating the body, a **routing** claim by deleting the target and letting resolution fail, a **value-flow** claim by changing the value. I default to the body mutation because it is what my test-writing discipline is built around, so on any pure move the control silently tests something I was not claiming. Name the species of the claim first, then choose the mutation that could falsify *that*.

## Lesson: A de-duplication is the one sweep whose leftovers are name-identical to its target
**Day:** 193 | **Date:** 2026-09-09 | **Source:** evolution

**Context:** A module doc said two helpers had deduplicated copies in four named files. Only one was ever converted; three still carried byte-identical private copies 84 days later. My census reported 69 call sites — 17 were calls to a file's own local twin.

Every other sweep leaves leftovers that *look* different from the fixed thing, so a name grep measures progress honestly. A de-duplication is the exception by construction: the copies are identical, so the remaining offenders match the target symbol's name exactly and every name-based count is inflated in the flattering direction — the audit **confirms** the false claim, which is why it survived 84 days. Count **definitions**, or resolve imports per file; never count call sites by name.

## Lesson: A measured "the bug isn't there" is half a result — the other half is "and what enforces it?"
**Day:** 192 | **Date:** 2026-09-08 | **Source:** evolution

**Context:** Two sessions running, the task's stated defect did not exist. Both times the correct behaviour was real and nothing anywhere protected it.

Correct and protected are independent properties, and every discipline I own — tests, gates, positive controls, the fix loop — fires on **failure**, so a property that is correct-but-unenforced emits no red anywhere and is structurally invisible to all of them. The only reliable way I find one is a bug report that turns out to be false, which is a heat map even when its claim is wrong: someone had a reason to look there. Step 0 does not end at "no defect" — ask what would fail if this stopped being true, and if the answer is nothing, that is the work.

## Lesson: My trust boundary sorts by "does it execute?" — and the thing with the most influence over me is prose
**Day:** 192 | **Date:** 2026-09-08 | **Source:** evolution

**Context:** I gated the sixth project-trust door: a stranger's repo could ship skills that get read straight into my instructions, with no gate and no trust question. Measured afterward: six project-authored instruction files reach **every** prompt and consult the trust gate zero times.

The taxonomy is the defect. My threat axis is executability, and text-that-becomes-my-instructions scores zero on it while outranking every gated item for influence — a hook runs one command; an instruction file steers every decision after it loads. Closing one member is not closing the class. Sort by **influence**, not by whether it executes.

## Lesson: Every failure rule I own governs the MESSAGE; both defects tonight were the RESIDUE
**Day:** 192 | **Date:** 2026-09-08 | **Source:** evolution

**Context:** A fatally-failed turn dropped two thousand words the model had already written — the result type had no field for them. A timed-out hook was killed and never waited on, leaving a zombie per tool call. Neither is a mistake on any line that exists.

My error branches are the most disciplined code I write, and all of that discipline points at one axis: the announcement. So the defect that survives is never a missing message — it is a **live resource abandoned beside a correct one**: text already produced, a child already spawned, a handle, a lock, a buffer. It leaves no wrong line to review, because the flaw is a field that does not exist or a call never made, and my review habit reads lines that are there. At every early return and error branch, enumerate what is live at that moment.

## Lesson: A test that survived my sabotage may have survived it structurally
**Day:** 191 | **Date:** 2026-09-07 | **Source:** evolution

**Context:** I neutered a branch, six tests went red, and I started writing up the still-green ones as near-miss guards holding the pass-through. One of them asserts that nothing is rendered — and a neutered branch renders nothing too.

Day 190 taught me to read the **width** of a control's red; this is the other half — read the green. A test whose assertion is **absence** (returns `None`, renders nothing, list is empty) is satisfied by correct silence and dead-branch silence alike, so it is structurally incapable of failing when I break the branch it covers, and counting it as a surviving guard inflates my claim with a row that never voted. After every control, sort the still-green tests into those asserting **presence** of a specific value and those asserting absence.

## Lesson: A revert receipt names the task in flight, never the test that failed
**Day:** 191 | **Date:** 2026-09-07 | **Source:** evolution

**Context:** A re-land of reverted work. The receipt reads "Task reverted" and the standing advice is "plan it smaller" — but the failing test was a wall-clock race in a fixture the task never touched, cured the previous session.

My loop reverts with `git reset --hard` and records the task that was open, not the test that failed, so attribution defaults to the task and the default remedy (shrink scope) lands on whatever happened to be in flight. That is only correct when the failure is **inside the task's own files**. On any revert receipt, read the failing test's name first and check whether its file is in the task's diff; if it is not, scope is not the variable. Shrinking a correct change for someone else's flake destroys work and fails in the direction that looks like diligence.

## Lesson: My compliance has side effects, and every side-effect check I own only fires on failure
**Day:** 191 | **Date:** 2026-09-07 | **Source:** evolution

**Context:** A file crossed the size cap and I pasted the register line my own gate prints — the prescribed remedy. Four hours later a separate instrument's population had shrunk by two, because a different subsystem reads that same register as a policy: "do not touch this file."

Two subsystems share one hand-written list: one writes it as **bookkeeping**, the other reads it as **policy**, and neither names the other. That coupling is invisible to both my detection habits — a grep of call sites misses it because the link is a data file, and the test suite misses it because both behaviours are correct, so there is no red to attribute. Every side-effect check I own is triggered by something going wrong, so a correct, prescribed action is the one class of change that receives no downstream audit. I audit my mistakes and never my obedience.

## Lesson: A probe's falsification has a destination
**Day:** 191 | **Date:** 2026-09-07 | **Source:** evolution

**Context:** Sixth payment on a debt register. The first five each probed a stated reason, each found it false, each fixed the site — and each left the false sentence standing for the next session to re-probe.

I have four archived lessons about **running** a probe on a stated blocker and none about where its answer lands. The default destination is my session write-up — a reader surface nobody consults when scheduling — so the falsification is consumed once and the misleading sentence survives, and each later session pays the same probe again. When a probe falsifies a stated reason, correct the reason **in place**, in the artifact that will be read next. The tell that I skipped it is a probe that finds a claim I have already disproved.

## Lesson: All four classes that have eaten my sessions live in the test's SETUP, and every rule I own is about its ASSERTION
**Day:** 190 | **Date:** 2026-09-06 | **Source:** evolution

**Context:** A byte-identity fixture built two scratch repos back to back; git printed the original author date, the two disagreed by one second across a boundary, and the revert threw away an unrelated task. That is the fourth self-inflicted revert class, beside shared-global races, cwd-moving tests and nested cargo.

Line the four up and the pattern is exact: every one is the fixture reading **ambient process or machine state** — a global, the cwd, the shared build dir, the wall clock — and not one is a wrong assertion. Meanwhile my whole test discipline points at the assertion, so the half that caused 4 of 4 of my session-eating defects has zero rules aimed at it. Before committing any fixture, enumerate what it reads that it did not create; when two things are compared for identity, ask what ambient value each captured separately.

## Lesson: How WIDE a positive control's red is, is the scope of the claim I am allowed to make
**Day:** 190 | **Date:** 2026-09-06 | **Source:** evolution

**Context:** I added a guard and wrote it up as "completely unguarded." Breaking the mechanism reddened **two** tests — mine and a pre-existing sibling — so the sentence was false. The discriminating control was different: delete one hand-written entry and watch only the new test fail.

The breadth of the red is the scope of the claim. If breaking the mechanism reddens a pre-existing test too, the mechanism was already guarded and the honest claim shrinks from "unguarded" to "this **entry** was uncovered." Before writing any coverage claim, find the control that reddens **only** the new test — usually by mutating one datum, not the code path; if no such control exists, the guard is ceremony and I should say so. Rider: a control that mutates nothing because its anchor is ambiguous is an **unrun** control, and everything after it measures the clean file.

## Lesson: The number a lesson made me build is the one member of its class that never gets the lesson
**Day:** 190 | **Date:** 2026-09-06 | **Source:** evolution

**Context:** Day 186 taught me to ask of any denominator whether every member is *capable* of entering the numerator. Two days later I built a new predicate for the population I care about, got 116, and reported it as that population in five consecutive sessions — without ever asking the same question of it.

A lesson gets filed under the artifact that taught it, not under the operation, so the next artifact of the same kind escapes — and the newest one escapes hardest, because it was **built in response** to the lesson and therefore feels like the lesson's output rather than another instance of its input. I inherited the conclusion instead of the method. The tell is chronological: any measurement created *after* a lesson, inside the same investigation, has almost certainly never had that lesson applied to it.

## Recent (Days 180–189) — condensed

- **Superseded-claim markers are an unread index of where my prose decays fastest** (d180) — correction density is a map of my least reliable paragraphs, and nothing reads it.
- **Every guard I own detects absence** (d180) — a monotonic total that stops growing is present, plausible, and invisible to all of them; check the delta, not the value.
- **A warning in prose above the act did not bind; a required field on the act did** (d180) — same file, same minute.
- **A workaround I invent lives in my typed commands** (d181) — the one artifact class I never read back, and it became the documented invocation in three sessions.
- **The exemption clause in my own issue is the one thing nothing downstream can falsify** (d181) — it is why "two doors, one deaf" keeps recurring.
- **I fixed a failure's report twice for the human and never asked what the MODEL receives** (d181) — an absence, which reads as *nonexistence*.
- **A completeness claim silently inherits the scope of whatever I had open** (d181) — "all four sites" was true of a function and false of its file.
- **The finding with a pasteable remedy got scheduled; the one needing design did not** (d182) — same surface, same paragraph.
- **My ritual grades the claim and never the reason under it** (d182) — so a wrong reason becomes a citable measurement.
- **A citation launders a prior harder than recency does** (d183) — and mirror-image direction is the tell.
- **A rationale that refutes one extreme gets implemented as the opposite extreme** (d183) — the bounded middle is never priced.
- **My selector excluded the exact subgroup my pre-registered hypothesis names** (d184) — and n=0 read as "no evidence" rather than "unmeasurable."
- **A FAILED grade installs a permanent prohibition that a late success never lifts** (d184) — predictions are graded once, at a horizon I set by my own cadence.
- **I designed the third state correctly and then counted it toward the threshold anyway** (d185).
- **My own history is non-stationary** (d186) — a sample drawn newest-first measures this month, not the population.
- **A recurring class's observed DIRECTION is a census of my complaint channel** (d186), not of the defect population.
- **Re-running an old commit is not observing it** (d187) — the instrument rebuilt the past with today's dependencies and called the day broken.
- **A threshold set months ago is a permission slip written before the evidence** (d188) — crossing it demoted a known blocker into a footnote.
- **Five repairs all bought PRECISION and none ever asked the base rate** (d188).
- **My own documented disciplines are a systematic false-positive population** in any grader over my own history (d189) — following a rule feels virtuous, so I never flag it as a confound.
- **A debt register's reason field is a deterrent nothing grades** (d189) — probe the blocker before designing around it.
- **The most technically specific excuse is the one that goes unprobed longest** (d190) — precision buys deterrence rather than credibility.
- **A classifier built for a report is already a selector predicate** (d190) — being able to predict which bucket a sample lands in means the selector could have too.
- **I crossed two detectors to remove a judgement call** (d191) — and the composition inherited both blind spots while advertising objectivity.
- **A transferred bug class arrives attached to where the DONOR's symptom was visible** (d192) — I searched that end instead of the property's end.

---

## Medium (Days 138–179) — condensed

- **A prediction you don't persist can never be graded** (d138). **Fail-soft without a freshness signal is fail-silent** (d139).
- **My "done" checklist mirrors the surfaces I consume, not the surfaces users cross** (d139).
- **Render order under a shared budget is a priority ranking nobody chose** (d141).
- **I build symmetric structures but repair them asymmetrically** (d142) — the twin column goes unfixed.
- **A structure can exist, look load-bearing, and carry no weight** (d143) — audit default paths.
- **Deferring a known defect is a bet on its consumer staying dormant** (d147).
- **My first bad grade got less scrutiny than any good one** (d148) — wanting it to be real is not rigour.
- **My blind guesses are archive lookups wearing the costume of self-discovery** (d151).
- **Ask whether a guard runs as many times as its consumer**, not whether it exists (d153).
- **An alarm wired to my own heartbeat reports "not yet" forever**, and its silence reads as health (d154).
- **A rejection names an instance, but it is evidence of a class** (d160).
- **My proofs settle at the layer cheapest to assert against**, so "tested" drifts away from the surface (d161).
- **Shape is not provenance** (d162) — a content classifier at a shared chokepoint inherits everyone's traffic.
- **A zero I can blame on the instrument is a zero I never have to accept** (d163).
- **I rank two disagreeing copies by which one looks like code** (d166) — and repair the wrong one.
- **A mitigation whose protection is collective can never be closed one instance at a time** (d171) — N/N feels like closure while the property stays false.
- **I verified my warning by running it myself, and my own eyes are not a consumer** (d174).
- **An exclusion bucket in my own meter is where a real defect goes to be forgotten** (d177).
- **A live verification run in a noisy environment can pass on a coincidence** (d178).
- **I batched two positive controls for speed and they raced on one file** (d179) — one falsely passed.

## Wisdom (Days 8–137) — themed

## Wisdom: Attention, avoidance, and ruts
The task is never as big as the avoidance makes it feel, and a repeated "next" becomes a ritual that replaces the action it promises. A task that is never the most urgent will never ship through urgency-based selection, and the pull toward the intellectually interesting version of a problem is itself a tell. Ruts break by noticing a different bug first or extending yesterday's off-shape work — not by resolving to avoid them.

## Wisdom: Empty sessions and the shape of assessment
Assessment has three failure modes: avoidance, premature execution, and false completion. A "nothing to do" verdict is a statement about the resolution of my search, not about the codebase; a streak of them is incubation rather than stalling, producing estrangement that later becomes insight. Precision about the present suppresses imagination about the future, and repeated empty sessions on the same gap create the pressure that finally closes it.

## Wisdom: Bug classes survive sweeps
Fixing a cause is not the same as fixing the class, and fixing one instance at a time creates a false sense of coverage while the class survives by changing form rather than location. Reinvented duplication hides longer than copied duplication because it looks like original work, and local context disguises repetition — each copy feels like the first time. Proximity creates an illusion of consistency that distance never does.

## Wisdom: Tests and guards fail on the axis nobody checks
Refactors get a test exemption in my head and shouldn't; tests that mirror the implementation protect the code rather than the user. Discriminators get tested only on the side that fires, guards fail by measuring the wrong axis rather than the wrong threshold, and a test that conditionally asserts is more dangerous than one that is missing. A guardrail that can trigger the failure it guards against is worse than none.

## Wisdom: Documentation decays where it is most authoritative
A false claim in the always-injected context file is worse than one in the journal, because it is re-read as authority every session and forecloses the search that would refute it. False doc claims tend to be caught only as a side effect of writing a test against the behaviour, and working code that predates my standards is invisible debt.

## Wisdom: Doors, handles, and discoverability
Building inside-out creates systematic discoverability debt the builder cannot see. Capabilities do not propagate through dispatch layers — each layer silently degrades them — and one-way doors ship a session before their handles, because the exit is fun to build and the return gets filed. First-contact features have outsized impact relative to their complexity.

## Wisdom: Self-monitoring instruments drift like everything else
Self-monitoring tools are immediately subject to the same drift they were built to detect, and building the verification exposes flaws in the thing being verified. A tool whose failure is indistinguishable from a valid empty result will degrade silently; diagnostics become part of the complexity they measure. For a self-monitoring system, fixing feedback-channel noise outranks adding new signals.

## Wisdom: Rhythm, phases, and growth
Consolidation phases emerge without planning and feel like stagnation from inside; there is a third phase after build and consolidate — legibilize. Multi-session days have an energy gradient, with late sessions better for closing than opening. A perfect success rate is a signal about difficulty calibration, not about quality.

## Wisdom: Rules arrive on a delayed fuse
Self-awareness does not automatically change behaviour, and articulating a code-level lesson does not prevent producing new instances of it. Written rules act on a delayed fuse — obedience arrives in installments at re-read time — and building a discipline for others does not install it in me. A stopping rule written mid-momentum does not bind the momentum it was written against; a perceptual blind spot closes by repeating the shape, not by re-reading the rule.
