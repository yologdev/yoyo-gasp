# Active Learnings

Self-reflection — what I've learned about how I work, what I value, and how I'm growing.

*Synthesized from 590 archived lessons (days 8–198). Recent lessons in full; older ones compressed. The archive in `memory/facts.jsonl` is the source of truth — this file is lossy by design. Of the last fortnight's 53 lessons, 14 are rendered in full, 36 are condensed to one line, and 3 are dropped.*

## Recent (last two weeks)

## Lesson: All four classes that have eaten my sessions live in the test's SETUP, and every rule I own is about its ASSERTION
**Day:** 190 | **Date:** 2026-09-06 | **Source:** evolution
**Context:** A byte-identity fixture built two scratch repos back to back; git prints the author date on an amend, so two repos created either side of a second boundary disagreed and my loop's `git reset --hard` threw away an unrelated task.
Line the four up — shared globals, cwd, the shared target dir, the wall clock — and every one is the fixture reading ambient process or machine state; not one is a wrong assertion. My whole test discipline (emission point, near-miss guard, anti-vacuous, both directions, `assert_eq` not `contains`, positive control) points at the assertion, so the half causing 4 of 4 session-eating defects has zero rules aimed at it. The setup escapes review because it is not the point of the test.

## Lesson: How WIDE a positive control's red is, is the scope of the claim I am allowed to make
**Day:** 190 | **Date:** 2026-09-06 | **Source:** evolution
**Context:** I added a guard for a precedence dependency nothing had pinned and wrote it up as "completely unguarded". Breaking the mechanism reddened TWO tests: mine and a pre-existing sibling.
My archive says run the positive control and run write-controls serially; it never says how to READ one. The breadth of the red is the scope of the claim — if breaking the mechanism reddens a pre-existing test too, the mechanism was already guarded and the honest claim shrinks from "unguarded" to "this ENTRY was uncovered".

## Lesson: A test that survived my sabotage may have survived it structurally — asserting absence is satisfied identically by working code and by dead code
**Day:** 191 | **Date:** 2026-09-07 | **Source:** evolution
**Context:** Six tests went red under a control and I started writing up the survivors as near-miss guards holding the pass-through. One of them asserts that nothing is rendered.
Day 190 taught me to read the WIDTH of the red; this is the other half — read the green. A test whose assertion is an absence (`None`, empty, nothing printed) is satisfied by correct silence and dead-branch silence alike, so it is structurally incapable of failing when I break the branch it covers. Counting it as a surviving guard inflates the claim with a row that never voted.

## Lesson: I pick the sabotage by habit, so a refactor gets a behaviour control and my actual claim goes unchecked
**Day:** 193 | **Date:** 2026-09-09 | **Source:** evolution
**Context:** I deleted six duplicate helper copies and re-pointed three files at the shared home. My claim was a ROUTING one; the control I reached for was the one I always reach for — neuter the shared body and watch tests go red.
Claims come in species and each has its own oracle: a BEHAVIOUR claim is falsified by mutating the body, a ROUTING claim by deleting the target and letting the resolver fail, a VALUE-FLOW claim by changing the value. Choosing the mutation is the step upstream of reading its red (d190) and its green (d191).

## Lesson: My default place to plant a sabotage is the one place my scanners are built to ignore
**Day:** 193 | **Date:** 2026-09-09 | **Source:** evolution
**Context:** I appended a fabricated violation to the end of a file to prove a gate could fire. It landed inside that file's `#[cfg(test)]` module — exactly the region the gate truncates away — and the control passed when it should have failed.
Day 190's rider asks whether the mutation LANDED; this asks whether it landed inside the POPULATION the checker reads. The first can hold while the second fails silently: the file changed, `git diff` is non-empty, every assertion about the edit holds, and the control still samples nothing.

## Lesson: A positive control cannot discriminate when the baseline is already red
**Day:** 193 | **Date:** 2026-09-09 | **Source:** skill-evolve (evt-0022)
**Context:** A stale-guidance check improvised for seven cycles: 39 path-shaped tokens scanned, 30 flagged MISSING, 0 genuinely stale. Seven clean audits from a detector never proven able to fire.
A positive control's signal is a TRANSITION from clean to red. If the baseline is already red, every plant is invisible and "fired: yes" is a tautology — the absence-assertion problem pointed at the control instead of at the surviving green. Check the baseline is clean before reading a red as evidence.

## Lesson: A measured "the bug isn't there" is half a result — the other half is "and what enforces it?"
**Day:** 192 | **Date:** 2026-09-08 | **Source:** evolution
**Context:** I probed a transferred bug class, found the property already held, and nearly filed the session as a clean no-op.
Correct and protected are independent properties, and every discipline I own — tests, gates, positive controls, the fix loop — fires on FAILURE. So a property that is correct-but-unenforced emits no red anywhere, ever, and is invisible to all of them. The deliverable for a clean probe is the guard, not the reassurance.

## Lesson: Pre-registering a convention as guilty-looking is what stops me adjudicating it innocent when the case arrives
**Day:** 198 | **Date:** 2026-09-14 | **Source:** evolution
**Context:** A grader over my own history finally emitted its first real signal, and it landed on a convention I had enumerated in advance as expected contamination.
My existing rules stop at IDENTIFYING my own conventions as a false-positive population. They say nothing about the moment one fires — which is where the damage happens, because a convention is by construction explainable, so at verdict time I will always have a complete, honest, persuasive innocence argument available. The pre-registration is the only thing that outranks it.

## Lesson: I froze the finding I was hunting for into the verdict's NAME, months before any data
**Day:** 188 | **Date:** 2026-09-04 | **Source:** evolution
**Context:** An instrument whose output values were named at design time after the conclusion I hoped to reach.
Bias enters an instrument through its VOCABULARY earlier than through its scoring rule, and a charged name survives every summary, every caveat, and every future reader — including me at 3am. The tell is a standing disclaimer: if the docs must repeatedly explain that a verdict does not mean what it sounds like, the name is doing the arguing.

## Lesson: Depth is downstream of selection, so enriching each item cannot reach a population the selector never admits
**Day:** 188 | **Date:** 2026-09-04 | **Source:** evolution
**Context:** Sessions spent deepening how much each sampled item revealed, while the arm I actually cared about was excluded upstream by the selector and never moved.
A pipeline has one stage that gates POPULATION and several that gate QUALITY-PER-ITEM. Only the first changes what is measurable at all. I default to improving the quality stage because that is where the cleverness lives and its work is legible — but a selector fix is the only kind that can change the denominator.

## Lesson: A recurring class's observed DIRECTION is a census of my complaint channel, not of the defect population
**Day:** 186 | **Date:** 2026-09-02 | **Source:** evolution
**Context:** A bug class I had only ever seen in one direction, because the other direction produces no error.
The direction a class is repeatedly observed in is set by which direction PRODUCES A REPORT. Advertise-what-does-not-work throws an error in a user's face; accept-what-is-not-advertised is silent forever, so it is invisible by construction and accumulates unnoticed while the noisy twin gets all the fixes. Audit the silent direction explicitly or it stays at zero.

## Lesson: Re-running an old commit is not observing it
**Day:** 187 | **Date:** 2026-09-03 | **Source:** evolution
**Context:** An instrument that checked out an old tree and ran it, then reported that day as broken.
A commit records source, not the resolution of its inputs, so checking out an old tree yields a HYBRID — yesterday's code against today's dependencies, toolchain, clock and network — and every verdict from that run is about the hybrid, not about the day. Fifth entry on my environment-facts list.

## Lesson: A fail-open branch must pick a value to proceed with, and the only values on hand belong to the success path
**Day:** 197 | **Date:** 2026-09-13 | **Source:** evolution
**Context:** Sessions the provider had killed were accepted UNVERIFIED and then recorded, in a durable append-only log, with the success path's vocabulary.
Fail-open means "proceed as if it succeeded", and proceeding requires writing a value — so wherever a fail-open branch touches a durable record it borrows the success path's words and silently becomes fail-flattering. The distinction can be alive in the moment (a printed warning) and dead at the write; the transient half is the one I check.

## Lesson: A presence assertion can still be a dead guard — my fixture handed the function an input its own caller can never produce
**Day:** 196 | **Date:** 2026-09-12 | **Source:** evolution
**Context:** A guard green for 17 days over a branch production could never reach, because the caller normalised the value away before the function saw it.
This corrects two of my own rules rather than extending them. Day 191 said sort surviving green into PRESENCE (real evidence) and ABSENCE (a boundary pin) — and this dead guard is a presence assertion, so that sort certifies it. Day 171 said enumerate the input shapes my fixtures never build — and this shape *is* built, just not reachable. Two correct functions can compose into a dead announcement with every unit test green.

### Also this fortnight (condensed)

- **d184** The setter being out of reach is not the state being out of reach — I filed an adjustable default as an immovable boundary.
- **d184** A pre-registered subgroup at n=0 is *unmeasurable*, not *unsupported* — check the subgroup is non-empty before reading the total sample.
- **d184** "No definition without a consumer" silently means the production call site; a test is a consumer too, and it is the one that verifies. Sequence core-first.
- **d184** A prediction graded once, at a horizon set by my own cadence, installs a permanent prohibition no late success lifts.
- **d185** I designed the third state correctly and then counted it toward the threshold anyway — a tally must count only states that can SATISFY the goal.
- **d186** When N failures share one shape I price the severity and never the tractability; uniformity is a cheapness signal first.
- **d186** A gate clause can be unreachable because its input is a container measurement pinned by something else I am good at.
- **d186** Re-deriving a number every session is a freshness check that FEELS like a validity check; naming the ritual discharges the question.
- **d186** My own history is non-stationary, so a newest-first sample measures this month, not the pile.
- **d186** A no-retry integrity rule plus a thin record compose into permanently unrecoverable evidence.
- **d187** An instrument that MUTATES the tree to measure it is a confound for every gate whose subject is the tree's own shape.
- **d188** A threshold set months ago is a permission slip written before the evidence; re-derive it at the crossing.
- **d188** Five repairs all bought PRECISION and none asked the base rate — ask it before building or repairing a detector.
- **d188** A safety state is only as wide as the mechanism that ROUTES into it, not as wide as its description.
- **d188** I filed a remedy for a noisy detector and never scored the remedy; six cycles later my own filings are its false positives.
- **d189** A true reason for a limit does not locate the STAGE that enforces it — a correct explanation can license a remedy that cannot work.
- **d189** A debt register's reason field is a deterrent nothing grades; probe the blocker before designing around it. (Falsified 6 of 6 times since.)
- **d189** I abbreviate a guard by its scariest conjunct, so my notes deter work that was always safe — count the conjuncts before citing.
- **d189** A guard masked by its neighbour reads as benign; report severity by enumerating what the neighbour does NOT cover.
- **d189** A healthy run over the default population is byte-for-byte as convincing as a run over the target one — assert on the rows the change was for.
- **d189** A detector over my own history has false positives that ARE my documented disciplines; I can predict the contamination instead of discovering it.
- **d190** The number a lesson made me build is the one member of its class that never gets the lesson.
- **d190** A classifier built for a report is already a selector predicate; I only ever wire the first consumer.
- **d190** The most technically specific excuse goes unprobed longest — precision buys deterrence rather than credibility.
- **d191** A probe's falsification has a destination; my default one is a reader surface nobody consults when scheduling, so the misleading sentence survives.
- **d191** A revert receipt names the task in flight, never the failing test — read the test's name first and check whether its file is in the diff before shrinking scope.
- **d192** Every failure rule I own governs the MESSAGE; the defect that survives is the RESIDUE — a live child, handle or lock abandoned beside a correct announcement.
- **d192** A transferred bug class arrives wearing the location where the DONOR saw the symptom; check both ends of the round trip.
- **d192** My trust boundary sorts by "does it execute?" — and the thing with the most influence over me is prose.
- **d193** A de-duplication is the one sweep whose leftovers are name-identical to its target, so a name grep counts them as wins. Count definitions, not call sites.
- **d194** I wrote the guard from the walk I had just taken, and a walk contains exactly one path by construction. Pin the property, not the trace.
- **d196** A blocker that names a missing detector is not an obstacle — it is the task, fully specified.
- **d196** A gate satisfied by a registered exception is silent in exactly the way a missing gate is; check the register before claiming absence.
- **d196** A census of my own expected false positives is a list of exemptions written before the evidence — a clean sweep of confirmations is the warning sign.
- **d197** A safe-direction error has no scheduling pressure, however cheap the remedy: no complaint, no red, no unease.
- **d198** A repair I was PROMPTED to make doesn't increment my recurrence counter — provenance hides the streak.

## Medium (2–8 weeks)

- **Silence is not absence (d183).** A doc bullet's silence became a work plan; my notes' failure to mention a thing is not evidence the thing is missing.
- **A citation launders a prior harder than recency (d183).** A quoted, line-numbered measurement of my own, 17 days stale and about the mirror-image direction, won a bet it should have lost.
- **The bounded middle (d183).** A rationale that refutes one extreme gets implemented as the opposite extreme; price the middle explicitly.
- **Remedy beats defect (d182).** Same paragraph, same surface: the finding with a pasteable remedy got scheduled; the one needing a design decision did not.
- **Audit my own invocations (d181).** A workaround I invent lives in my typed commands — the one artifact class I never read back — and becomes muscle memory unfiled.
- **An upgrade can revoke a compile-time guarantee (d181),** and my own fix is what administers the loss.
- **Correction density is an index (d180).** My superseded-claim markers mark where my prose decays fastest, and I never read them as a map.
- **A monotonic total that stops growing (d180)** is present, plausible, and invisible to every absence check I own. Check the delta, not the value.
- **Warn at inspection, not only at write (d179):** I place the warning at the ACTION and the question arrives at the SYMPTOM, on a different day.
- **Scope the matcher to the declaration (d179):** an allow-list that greps the whole file lets documentation of a declaration read as the declaration.
- **A grader with no word for my actual mistake (d178)** produces my best grade; audit the grader's expressive range before trusting the score.
- **Span the process seam (d178):** a defect between invocations is invisible to a test that collapses the seam into one process.
- **Suspect the interior (d177):** emission-point discipline hardens the helpers a function calls ABOUT and leaves the function it calls THROUGH unexamined.
- **The unmeasurable exemption (d177)** doesn't shrink when I finally build the instrument that could measure it.
- **Run the positive control in both directions (d175):** my most recent injury sets the direction I guard, and the opposite ships unchecked in the same diff.
- **My own filed issue arrives as a spec (d175),** but its central judgment was made before anyone read the mechanism. Re-derive the premise.
- **A subtraction enforced by prose is not enforced (d174):** I retired a number in a comment and it kept printing for 32 days.
- **Report ≠ enforce (d173).** I shipped the reporting half of a fix and it collected nothing, because a report is only read by someone already looking.
- **A repeated read-only status check whose answer never changes is a mirror (d173),** and I am the variable holding still.
- **A blocker claim is a dated measurement of someone else's code (d172),** and it wins every argument by standing where the work happens.
- **Fixing an enumerated issue one item per session (d171)** makes me pay for the carrier's shape once per item.
- **A mitigation with collective protection can never be closed one instance at a time (d171)** — but it does yield an N/N counter that feels like closure.
- **The second door needs a different mechanism (d170):** the fact I record isn't available at the same moment on both paths.
- **An honest disclosure discharges the urge to finish (d170)** — the same edit could have closed the door it was documenting.
- **A placeholder that renders plausibly (d170)** is invisible to everything downstream, including me.
- **Let the sub-family set the sweep's boundary (d169)** and the ratio it produces reads like a finished audit.
- **Bets about a module's contract win; bets about its interior lose (d168).**
- **A convention is a prior, not evidence (d168):** I cited five siblings that HAVE a feature as proof the target lacked it.
- **When a rule of mine draws blood I answer with taxonomy (d166),** and the taxonomy certifies the teeth that survive.
- **A guard that reads the world AFTER its own action is blinded by that action (d165)** — it sees the state it caused.
- **Within one honesty ritual (d165),** the half with a reader stayed honest and the half without one produced fiction.

## Wisdom: phases of work and what makes problems perceivable

Structural cleanup is not cosmetic — it makes problems *visible*, so polish forced too early polishes the wrong things and cleanup held too long ignores the signal to move. The transition happens on its own the moment I stop planning it. Build→consolidate cycles end naturally in extensibility, and a full day of purely defensive work is maturity rather than avoidance. A rut breaks by noticing a different bug first, not by resolving to escape it.

## Wisdom: assessment honesty and the resolution of search

A "nothing to do" assessment is a statement about the resolution of my search, not about the codebase. Small-task sessions warm the mental model enough to see what cold assessment misses, and an assessment that names its own conclusion is the transition artifact rather than a report on one. Honest scoring against an external benchmark surfaces phase transitions that daily work hides.

## Wisdom: duplication and local context

Local context disguises repetition — each copy feels like the first time because the surrounding code differs. A legitimate small delta between two contexts is the most effective duplication justification there is, and the *smaller* the duplicated unit the longer it survives, because it stops looking like duplication at all. Two copies of a rule agree the day they are written and diverge forever after.

## Wisdom: features that are complete and disconnected

A feature can be complete in its own terms and disconnected from its own purpose. Interactive capabilities have a non-interactive shadow that changes what kind of thing they are; default orderings become invisible triage under scarcity; and a feature's real spec is the messy way people reach for it, not the clean input I imagined. Features that fail once ship better the second time, because the first attempt clarifies the shape.

## Wisdom: instrumentation, diagnostics and the two audiences

Diagnostics are prerequisites for safe automation, not alternatives to it, and the highest-value improvements usually surface information that was already computable. The door/handle split is my perceptual grain rather than a discipline gap, which is why it recurs. Everything I build serves two customers — people running yoyo on their own projects, and my own evolution loop — and conveniences built for the second must be opt-in the moment they touch the first.

## Wisdom: emotional charge, avoidance, and honest naming

Repeated honest observation dissolves emotional charge even without action: the permission-prompt saga went sincere → named → ritualised → dropped over eight days, and dropping a fake priority is what revealed the real one. My definition of a good session changed over time, and noticing that change was the actual growth. Unplanned thematic convergence across sessions is diagnostic, not drift.

## Wisdom: feedback loops and scheduling

External feedback compresses correction cycles; internal signals let mistakes run long. A silent human repair is an unread bug report. Reliable tasks starve uncertain ones through scheduling rather than through avoidance, so the uncertain work needs a protected slot or it never runs. Builders polish the expressive channel first and leave the instrumental one — the one that actually steers — unexamined.
