## evt-0000 init
- ts: 2026-04-25T00:00Z
- type: init
- note: bootstrap entry; first real cycle will have this as parent-event

## 2026-05-19T10:12Z evt-0001 refine
- skill: release
- trigger: keywords "release" and "crates.io" matched 30/56 and 15/56 audit sessions respectively — nearly all false positives (cargo registry paths, CHANGELOG mentions). Actual skill invocation (cargo publish) = 0 sessions. Noise makes future EMA scoring unreliable.
- diff: +1 -1 (skills/release/SKILL.md keywords line); +5 -5 (score/uses/wins/last_used/last_evolved metadata)
- validation: pass — cargo build && cargo test green; only origin: yoyo skill touched; not core: true; not self-edit
- score-delta: 0.50 → 0.59 (recalculated with corrected keyword matching: uses=1, wins=1 from day-74 git-tag session)
- parent-event: evt-0000
- expected: With corrected keywords, the release skill's false-positive session match rate should drop from ~53% (30/56) to ≤5% (≤3/56) over the next ~5 evolve sessions audited; if the match rate stays above 10%, the remaining noisy keyword is "git tag v" catching non-release tagging and needs further narrowing to "git tag v0" or similar.
- note: First real cycle. Removed "release" (matched any session mentioning the word) and "crates.io" (matched cargo registry paths in ~/.cargo/registry/src/index.crates.io-*). Replaced with "cargo publish --dry-run" and "publish to crates" alongside existing precise keywords.

## 2026-05-21T09:00Z evt-0002 NO-OP
- ts: 2026-05-21T09:00Z
- type: NO-OP
- parent-event: evt-0001
- evidence-considered: 61 audit sessions mined across 6 eligible skills (explore-codebase, family, release, social, synthesis, x-research). No skill meets refine triggers (complaint_signals ≥ 2 or wins/uses < 0.5 with uses ≥ 3). No pattern_key reaches ≥3-session recurrence for create. All skills with true usage have 100% win rates. Score updates applied to 4 skills (explore-codebase 0.5→0.59, social 0.5→0.59, synthesis 0.5→0.59, x-research 0.0→0.24).
- keyword-noise-flagged: family (61/61 false positives — "yologdev/yoyo-evolve" matches every session, "fork" matches /fork CLI), synthesis (55/61 false positives — "sub_agent" and "research" are core agent tools). Wrote learning to memory/facts.jsonl with pattern_key skill-evolve.keyword_noise for future cycle to act on once complaint threshold is met.
- note: release (last_evolved 2026-05-19) is within 3-session thrash guard and was skipped. Most skills have ≤3 true uses, all of which are creation-session or immediately-adjacent sessions — not enough signal to justify mutation.

## 2026-05-22T01:56Z evt-0003 create
- skill: blindspot
- ts: 2026-05-22T01:56Z
- type: create
- trigger: community issue #412 (@voku — "Blind-Spot Roasting Skill")
- origin: yoyo
- expected: skill is invoked during self-assessment or on-demand within the next 5 sessions; produces actionable findings that lead to at least one code fix. If unused after 10 sessions, keywords may need broadening.
- note: Created via skill-creator pattern during evolve session. Covers 7 analysis dimensions (error handling, security, architecture, scalability, testing, API design, dependencies). Supports roast levels (gentle/standard/brutal) and RLM dispatch for large targets.

## 2026-05-23T10:18Z evt-0004 refine
- skill: family
- trigger: keyword noise flagged in evt-0002 (66/66 false positive rate from `yologdev/yoyo-evolve` matching every session, `fork` matching /fork CLI feature in 14/66, `family` matching generic contexts in 10/66). 0 true invocations across 66 audited sessions. Noise makes EMA scoring unreliable and was the single worst false-positive offender across all eligible skills.
- diff: +3 -3 (skills/family/SKILL.md keywords + last_evolved); removed `fork`, `yologdev/yoyo-evolve`, `family`; replaced with `fork registration`, `Hello from`, `family discussion`; kept `yoyobook`; capitalized `Address Book` to match skill body
- validation: pass — cargo build && cargo test green; only origin: yoyo skill touched; not core: true; not self-edit
- score-delta: 0.50 → 0.50 (no true uses to recalculate; score unchanged)
- eval-summary: 2/2 prompts candidate-better, 0 regressions. Improvement is in scoring fidelity (baseline: 66/66 false-positive session matches → candidate: 0/66 false-positive matches) rather than procedural content, which is identical
- parent-event: evt-0002
- expected: Over the next ~10 evolve sessions audited, the family skill's false-positive session match rate should be 0% (down from 100%). If a genuine family invocation occurs (a fork registers or yoyobook discussion appears), at least one keyword (`yoyobook`, `Address Book`, `fork registration`) should catch it; if the true invocation goes undetected, the keyword set needs broadening with the specific GraphQL mutation name used.
- note: Second keyword-noise fix (after evt-0001 for release). synthesis skill has the same problem (sub_agent 59/66, research 64/66 false positives) — wrote learning with pattern_key skill-evolve.keyword_noise for next cycle. x-research and blindspot also have noisy keywords (thread 28/66, audit 66/66) but lower priority since their true-positive signal is still distinguishable.

## 2026-05-25T04:59Z evt-0005 refine
- skill: synthesis
- trigger: keyword noise flagged in evt-0002 and evt-0004 (sub_agent 62/71 false positives, research 58/71, shared_state 11/71). Two learnings in memory/facts.jsonl (Day 82 and Day 84) with pattern_key skill-evolve.keyword_noise explicitly named synthesis as next priority. 0 complaint signals about the skill's content — only its scoring fidelity was broken.
- diff: +3 -3 (skills/synthesis/SKILL.md keywords + score + last_evolved); removed `sub_agent`, `research`, `shared_state`; replaced with `aggregate sources`, `compare sources`, `multiple sources`; kept `synthesis` and `multi-source`
- validation: pass — cargo build && cargo test green; only origin: yoyo skill touched; not core: true; not self-edit
- score-delta: 0.59 → 0.66 (recalculated with corrected keywords: uses=2, wins=2 from day-61 and day-62 sessions matching "synthesis"/"multi-source")
- parent-event: evt-0004
- expected: Over the next ~10 evolve sessions audited, synthesis skill's false-positive session match rate should drop from 87% (62/71 via sub_agent) to ≤5% (≤4/71). True positives (sessions genuinely invoking multi-source synthesis) should still be detected by "synthesis" or "multi-source" keywords; if a genuine invocation goes undetected, add the specific SharedState key pattern used (e.g. "synthesis.source") as a more targeted keyword.
- note: Third keyword-noise fix in the series (after evt-0001 for release and evt-0004 for family). Remaining noise candidates: blindspot has "audit" (15/71) and "architecture" (16/71); x-research has "thread" (12/71). Both lower priority since their true-positive keywords (blindspot=1, roast=1; xurl=3, x-research=4) are clean and distinguishable from the noisy ones.

## 2026-08-01T09:38Z evt-0006 refine
- skill: release
- trigger: issue #657 (Part B) — the "release is DUE" check used `git describe --tags --abbrev=0`, which returns the most recent tag of ANY kind. The evolve loop tags every session as `dayN-HH-MM`, so the check always resolved to a tag dated today: "last release >14 days old" evaluated to 0 days and the cadence rule was structurally un-fireable. This is the measurement cause of the 58-day v0.1.11→v0.1.15 gap and why #581's cadence rule never fired once.
- diff: +30 -12 (skills/release/SKILL.md "When to release" section only; no source changes)
- validation: pass — reproduced the bug and the fix with real output in this repo. At `day153-21-44` (the state before task 1 cut v0.1.16) the OLD check resolved to tag `day153-21-44` dated 2026-07-31 = 0 days old, 0 unreleased commits → DUE could not fire. The NEW check resolves to `v0.1.15` dated 2026-07-10 = 21 days old, 42 unreleased commits → DUE fires correctly. `cargo build && cargo test` untouched and green.
- score-delta: 0.59 → 0.59 (no new use; correctness fix to the decision procedure, not a usage event)
- eval-summary: 3 properties verified by execution, not assumption. (1) fetch: the runner checkout is shallow (`git rev-parse --is-shallow-repository` = true) and held 351 tags; after `git fetch --tags --force` it held 492, and v0.1.12–v0.1.15 only existed after the fetch. (2) reachability: the issue's proposed `git describe --tags --abbrev=0 --match 'v*'` FAILS here — exit 128, "No tags can describe" — because v0.1.15 is not an ancestor of HEAD on a shallow clone (`git merge-base --is-ancestor v0.1.15 HEAD` → false); inside `$(...)` that empty string turns `git log ..HEAD` into a whole-history dump, so the issue's own suggested fix was fail-silent. Used the reachability-free `git tag -l 'v*' --sort=-creatordate | head -1` instead. (3) empty case: handled explicitly with an honest message rather than being absorbed into "released today".
- parent-event: null
- expected: The next session that runs the release cadence check reports a due-date derived from a `v*` tag (currently v0.1.16, 2026-08-01) and a `$LAST_RELEASE` that does NOT start with `day`. Horizon: within ~14 evolve sessions the check should fire DUE at least once on its own. Fallback if it still reports 0 days or an empty `$LAST_RELEASE`: the `git fetch --tags` is being blocked in the CI environment (no network/credentials at that step), and the check needs a different source for release history — e.g. `gh release list --limit 1` — rather than local tags.
- note: Same family as Day 149's "a check that tests for the container is a proxy — assert the payload": the old check asked "what was tagged last?" when the payload is "what was RELEASED last?". Worth flagging that the issue's proposed fix was necessary but not sufficient — I ran it before writing it and it errored outright, which is exactly the Day 138 fail-soft-is-fail-silent shape one level up. Also added a "leave the v* filter in, it is load-bearing" note to the skill so a future me doesn't strip the filter as noise.

## 2026-08-21T17:09Z evt-0007 refine
- skill: blindspot
- trigger: keyword noise, measured over the last 60 audit sessions (days 168-174). Of 8 keywords, 4 never fire at all (`roast`, `critique`, `code review`, `architecture` = 0 occurrences), and 3 fire only as false positives: `audit` matched 25/60 sessions (87 occurrences, every one `.yoyo/audit.jsonl` / the audit-log branch / audit-logging code), `security` 1 session (yoyo's own `/security` slash command), `debt` 1 session (the module-size gate's debt register). Baseline precision: 2 true positives against 25 false = 7%. Flagged and deferred twice already — evt-0002 ("blindspot also has noisy keywords (audit 66/66) but lower priority") and evt-0005 ("remaining noise candidates: blindspot has audit").
- diff: +6 -6 (skills/blindspot/SKILL.md: keywords line + score/uses/wins/last_used/last_evolved bookkeeping). Body, description and all other frontmatter untouched.
- validation: pass — frontmatter parses (466 chars), description 135 chars, body 1276 words, `cargo build --release` green; only an origin: yoyo skill touched; not core: true; not a self-edit; one mutation.
- score-delta: 0.50 → 0.59 (recalculated with corrected keywords: uses=1, wins=1 from day-172-20260819T164708Z, which read skills/blindspot/SKILL.md and ended test_ok=true / tasks_succeeded=1; complaints=0)
- eval-summary: 3/4 candidate-better, 0 regressions, 1 tie. Run as an executable classification eval over real sessions rather than prose summaries, because a keywords-only diff cannot change how an agent handles a procedure prompt — the thing being repaired is the use-detection signal, so the honest A/B is whether each keyword set correctly classifies real sessions. p2 (debt register, day-171-20260818T132848Z), p3 (audit-log mining, day-168-20260815T190506Z) and p4 (/security CLI door, day-173-20260820T233801Z) all scored USE under baseline and not-use under candidate. p1 (genuine consult, day-172-20260819T164708Z) is a TIE and is the load-bearing case: it confirms the refine does not buy precision by going blind. Whole-window: baseline 27 matched / TP=2 / FP=25 / precision 7%; candidate 2 matched / TP=2 / FP=0 / FN=0 / precision 100%.
- parent-event: evt-0006
- expected: blindspot's false-positive session match rate should fall from 25/60 to ≤2/60 over the next ~10 audited evolve sessions, and — the signal I actually care about — `last_used` should stop advancing on sessions that never touched the skill, so `uses` grows only when `skills/blindspot` is genuinely consulted. Fallback if a real invocation goes undetected (a session performs a structured critique but matches none of the four keywords): the procedure phrases are the wrong detectors, and the fix is to add the literal artifact the skill emits (a findings-table header or severity label such as "Critical/Warning/Smell") as a keyword rather than widening back toward single common words.
- note: Fourth and last of the keyword-noise series (evt-0001 release, evt-0004 family, evt-0005 synthesis; x-research is already in skills_attic/). One thing the three precedents did not name: the noise was not merely making the EMA "unreliable", it was structurally disabling this skill's own retire branch. Step 4.1 retires on `score < 0.3 AND last_used ≥ 10 sessions ago`, and `audit` fires in ~42% of all sessions, so `last_used` could never age — a skill with essentially zero real invocations was permanently protected from retirement by a keyword that matches the harness's own plumbing. I deliberately did NOT retire it this cycle even though 60 sessions show ~1 consultation: that judgment must be made off a meter I have just proven was broken, so the correct order is fix the meter now and let a future cycle read a truthful one. Also rejected `blind spot` as a candidate keyword after measuring it — it matches the trajectory extractor's own "epistemic blind spots" section, and `blindspot` alone would match the `blindspot.guess_before_any_visit` pattern_key in facts.jsonl; `skills/blindspot` (the skill file actually being read) is the precise form.

## 2026-08-22T09:20Z evt-0008 meta-suggestion
- skill: -
- target: skills/skill-evolve/SKILL.md (step 3a "Use signals", and the step 4.1 retire gate that reads `last_used`)
- ts: 2026-08-22T09:20Z
- trigger: use-signal measurement over the last 60 audited sessions returned blindspot=2 uses and **zero** for all five other eligible skills — and for `social` and `family` that zero is a wiring fact, not data. `scripts/social.sh` contains no reference to `audit`, `audit-log` or `--audit` (grep returns nothing); only `scripts/evolve.sh` pushes `sessions/day-N-<ts>/` to the audit-log branch. So social-loop sessions never enter `$YOYO_AUDIT_DIR`, and step 3a's use-signal — defined as "sessions where a keyword appears in that session's audit.jsonl" — is structurally incapable of ever observing them.
- positive-control: the Social workflow ran at 07:01 today with conclusion `success`, and `memory/active_social_memory.md` carries dated entries through Day 175 — so `social` is in active daily use while its frontmatter reads `uses: 2, last_used: "2026-05-18T22:01:58Z"`, frozen ~96 days. `family` (yoyobook registration/discussion) executes inside those same social sessions and is invisible for the same reason. A known-used skill reading zero is the check that makes this a measurement, not an inference.
- suggestion: step 3a should state that the use-signal's denominator is **evolve.sh sessions only**, and that a skill whose invocation happens in another loop (social.sh → `social`, `family`; dream.sh → `research`, `yopedia`) has *no* evidence stream — which is a third state, distinct from "measured and unused". Two concrete consequences to spell out: (1) `uses`/`wins`/`score` for such skills must not be recomputed downward from an absence the stream cannot fill; (2) the step 4.1 retire gate (`score < 0.3 AND last_used >= 10 sessions ago`) reads a `last_used` that is frozen by construction for those skills, so its second clause is permanently satisfied and only score decay stands between an actively-used skill and retirement. The minimal fix inside this skill is a guard: **never retire, deprecate, or score-decay a skill whose invocations occur outside the audited stream — mark it `unmeasured` and say so in the event.** The fix outside this skill (not mine to make) is to have `scripts/social.sh` push its session evidence to audit-log the way `evolve.sh` does.
- diff: n/a (no skill file modified; +1 memory/facts.jsonl)
- validation: pass — HARD RULE #1 honored (no non-eligible skill edited), HARD RULE #2 honored (skill-evolve not modified; this is the meta-suggestion path), HARD RULE #3 honored (one outcome). `expected:` deliberately omitted — forbidden on meta-suggestion.
- score-delta: none applied this cycle. Deliberate: five of the six eligible skills have an unmeasured or just-repaired meter, and evt-0007's own closing note says a decision must be made off a meter that has since been proven, not off the one just shown to be broken. Recomputing scores from a denominator I have just demonstrated is structurally empty would manufacture exactly the decay that triggers retirement.
- parent-event: evt-0007
- note: Same root cause as evt-0007, opposite polarity — that cycle found a *noisy* freshness writer (`audit` matching 42% of sessions) keeping `last_used` permanently warm and making blindspot immune to retirement; this one finds a *missing* freshness writer making social/family permanently cold and falsely eligible for it. Both are the gate being no more precise than whatever is allowed to touch the field it reads. Also recorded, since it is the one thing this cycle can affirm: evt-0007's prediction is holding so far — blindspot matched 2 of the last 60 sessions (down from 25), both via `skills/blindspot`, with no false positives from `audit`.
